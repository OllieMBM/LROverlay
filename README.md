# Line Rider Overlay

Line Rider Overlay is a simple python script that converts .png or .jpg images into .json track files.

## Installation

Download and install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) via the command line to install Pillow

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

Place the script or executable inside its own folder, along with any files you wish to convert (**.png** or **.jpg** only).  The script will create a .json track file with the same name as the input file.
