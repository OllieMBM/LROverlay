# Line Rider Overlay
[Source Code](https://www.github.com/OllieMBM/LROverlay-Source)

Line Rider Overlay is a simple tool that converts .png or .jpg images into .json track files, allowing creators to quickly create detailed scenery for their Line Rider tracks.

## Usage

Place LROverlay.exe inside its own folder, along with any files you wish to convert (**.png** or **.jpg** only).  Run the file to create a .json track file with the same name as the input file.

Once the track file has been generated, place it inside a folder in your Tracks directory and open it in [Line Rider Advanced](https://linerideradvanced.com/)
